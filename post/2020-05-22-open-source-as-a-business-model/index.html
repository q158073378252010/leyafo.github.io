<p>We can freely use open source code in our products, but it&rsquo;s not paid for by the user.  There is a problem with this: what income do these open source project authors get? Some are side projects, but many are maintained as full-time jobs.</p>
<p>If you have created a popular project like redis or nginx, then many people will know what you can do in your professional field. The next step is to build a new server for your customers. Many people use your code, they will encounter new demands and you are an expert in this field, so you are the best key-man to solve the problem. Open sourcing your code and letting people try your code freely is the best marketing strategy for you. It&rsquo;s free and friendly.</p>
<p>If many people use your code but no one will want to pay for it. You&rsquo;ve just solved a little problem, not a business problem. Every programmer dreams of making software once and incoming forever, like an application still running on a server. This is insane, the real world doesn&rsquo;t work like this. Business problems always involve changes we make to adapt reality to the reality of not letting reality adapt to what we want.</p>
<p>For example, if you built a json parser, it is the fastest parser in the world. You want people to pay for this parser (It&rsquo;s better paid for monthly). Ask yourself these questions about your own software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why must your parser replace the other?</li>
<li>If people encounter problems when using your software, what do you do? How can you receive this information?</li>
<li>If no one uses json, what&rsquo;s your parser purpose for existence?</li>
<li>Your parser is just a tool; Why people should pay your monthly?</li>
<li>How do you continually meet new demands?</li>
</ol>
<p>Business problems are not like bugs; they are a series of problems. Suppose you want to make an APP like Uber, you have to let users run a mobile app with GPS, online payments, fast wireless networks, and a powerful battery. Before ten years ago, you couldn&rsquo;t build this app. Because you can&rsquo;t solve this series of problems. We call this is the industry chain. Your code only solves the one of the industry chains, and you must fully understand what you&rsquo;re solving and why it is important. Your code is a gun and your business knowledge is a guidance tool. Open source your code to meet the demands of the real world. It&rsquo;s a good marketing strategy because distributing your code is zero cost.</p>
